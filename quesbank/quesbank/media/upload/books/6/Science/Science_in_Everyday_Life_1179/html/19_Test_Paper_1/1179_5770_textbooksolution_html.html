How does it harm object?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rusting is a process by which iron forms iron oxide in the presence of oxygen and water. As a result of rusting</span>, a reddish brown layer called rust is formed on the surface of the iron, which falls off in course of time, again exposing the metal surface for further rusting.

It provides the essential nutrients for the plants which are called producers. All animals including humans are dependent on plants either directly or indirectly. The source of food for both plants and animals are obtained from the soil. Hence, we can say that we are dependent on soil.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:39</b></div><div>Explain the types of temperature scale.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Following are the type of temperature scale:<br />
(i) Celsius scale:&nbsp; Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius devised this scale in 1742, in which the lower fixed point is taken as 0<sup>0</sup>C, and upper fixed point is taken as 100<sup>0</sup>C. The interval between 0<sup>0</sup>C-100<sup>0</sup>C is divided into 100 parts where each part measures 1<sup>0</sup>C.<br />
(ii) Fahrenheit scale: Gabriel Fahrenheit devised this scale in which the lower and upper fixed points are taken as 32<sup>0</sup>F and 212<sup>0</sup>F respectively. The interval between 32<sup>0</sup>F-212<sup>0</sup>F is divided into 180 parts where each part measures 1<sup>0</sup>F.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:40</b></div><div>Write a short note on humidity.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere. Humidity can be measured using a device called hygrometer. The increase in temperature results in low humidity and the decrease in temperature results in higher humidity in the atmosphere. Humidity plays an important role in the life process of plants and animals as it promotes the growth of epiphytes, regulates the evaporation of water from the body of living organisms and helps in the germination of spores in fungus.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:41</b></div><div>What is crystallization? Describe in detail.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Crystallization is a process which involves the conversion of an impure compound to its crystals. </span>

<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For crystallization of a substance, it is first dissolved in water to have a saturated solution. A saturated solution is the one in which no further substance will dissolve.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The saturated solution is left undisturbed.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Crystals of the dissolved substance start growing from the saturated solution by the process of crystallization.</span></li>

If yes explain in detail.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Yes, both good and bad conductors of heat are useful to us. This can be explained by following points:
<ol>
	<li>While cooking, we use the utensils which are good conductors of heat, to cook food quickly, but their handles are made of bad conductors, so that it can be handled safely.</li>
	<li>Similarly, the electrical appliances we use, contains a metal core which is a good conductor, but the outside covering will be an insulated material, so as to ensure the safety of users.&nbsp;</li>
