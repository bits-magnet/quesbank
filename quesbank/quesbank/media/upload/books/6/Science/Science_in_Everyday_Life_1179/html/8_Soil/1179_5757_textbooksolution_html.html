The pot had a hole at its base through which water seeped out and was collected in a beaker. After a while, she measured the amount of water in the beaker and found it to be 450 ml. Find the percentage of water absorption of the soil if it weighed 1.5 kg in the pot.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Priya pours 1 litre of water into the pot. Therefore, Priya pours in 1000 ml of water.<br />
<br />
The amount of water seeped out is 450 ml.<br />
Therefore, 1000 - 450 = 550 ml is retained by the soil.<br />

The weight of soil is 1.5 kg = 1500 g.<br />

<ol>
	<li>Weathering, either chemical or physical, causes large rocks to break into smaller pieces, particularly near the surface.</li>
	<li>The smaller rocks weather into a fine layer of particles at the surface. Microorganisms decompose the remains the dead plants and animals and add humus to this layer making it nutrient rich.</li>
	<li>Minerals and salts from deep within the ground are carried by water and contribute to the mineral profile of the soil.</li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:13</b></div><div>Discuss the factors on which soil formation depends.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Soil formation depends upon various factors such as:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Climatic conditions:</strong> Climatic factors such as wind, rain, frost, etc., play an important role in loosening up rocks and weathering them into smaller pieces. Soil formation happens fastest in areas with hot and humid climatic conditions where bacterial activity rapidly breaks down dead plant and animal matter. However, soil formation is slower in regions of cold climate.</li>
	<li><strong>Characteristics of parent rock:&nbsp;</strong>The type of parent rock also determines the nature of soil formation and the time required for soil formation. The minerals in the soil are in general derived from the minerals in the parent rocks.</li>
	<li><strong>Slope of land:&nbsp;</strong>The slope of the land also influences soil type. In hilly regions, where the land is sloped, soil is frequently washed away and the soil is thin. On the plains, soil deposits are relatively undisturbed and a thick layer of soil is formed.</li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:14</b></div><div>Explain different horizons of soil profile.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Following are the different horizons of soil profile:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Horizon O</strong>: This is the topmost layer of soil, lying just above the topsoil layer and extends from the surface to a depth of 2 inches. It is rich in organic material.</li>
	<li><strong>Horizon A:</strong> Horizon A is the topsoil. It consists of fine particles and is rich in humus. This imparts the top soil its dark colour. The topsoil is soft, porous and can retain water. Horizon A extends from about 2 inches to 10 inches below the surface.</li>
	<li><strong>Horizon B: </strong>Horizon B extends from 10 inches to 30 inches below the surface. It is called the subsoil and is rich in minerals that have seeped in the water. It also contains fine particles of soil, compactly packed together.</li>
	<li><strong>Horizon C:</strong> This layer extends from about 30 inches, down to 48 inches below the surface. It contains partly weather pieces of rocks . This layer is characterised by cracks and fissures and it is very difficult to dig below this level.</li>
	<li><strong>Horizon R:</strong> Horizon R refers to bedrock. This rock determines the composition of the soil.</li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:15</b></div><div>What is soil erosion? Give the main reasons for soil erosion and methods by which it can be reduced.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>The removal of the fertile top layers of soil by running water or wind is termed as soil erosion. The main reasons for accelerated soil erosion are:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Once trees are felled, the soil is left loose and can be removed easily by running water or wind.</li>
	<li><strong>Overgrazing: </strong>The soil is then poorly bound and can be removed by wind or water.</li>
	<li><strong>Floods and heavy rains:&nbsp;</strong>Floods and heavy rains wash away large amounts of soil , particularly when there are no trees and the land is barren.</li>
	<li><strong>Poor farming practises:&nbsp;</strong>Improper farming on hill sides makes soil more vulnerable to erosion by wind or water.</li>
</ol>
Soil erosion can be minimized by:

<ol>
	<li>The growth of trees binds soil and minimizes erosion, known as afforestation.</li>
	<li>Building of dams may also help to stop the flow of water during heavy rains.</li>
	<li>Method of terrace farming should be used in hilly areas to minimize loss of soil on sloping terrain.</li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:16</b></div><div>What are the main sources of soil pollution? Write down the measures to control soil pollution.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>The major source of soil pollution are:
<ol>
	<li>Acid rains occurring due to factory pollution, mines and industries.</li>
	<li>Excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers that get accumulated in the soil.</li>
	<li>Usage of materials such as plastics and metals that do not decompose easily.</li>
</ol>
Following are the measures to control soil pollution:

<ol>
	<li>Avoid dumping solid waste on the land.</li>
	<li>Biogas should be produced from plant and animal wastes.</li>
	<li>Organic pesticides should be used.</li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:17</b></div><div>What is soil fertility? How can we improve soil fertility?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to provide nutrients in adequate quantity and balance to allow growth of plants.<br />
Soil fertility can be improved by:
<ul>
	<li>Controlling the soil pH.</li>
	<li>Adjusting the air content in the soil.</li>
	<li>Incorporation of fertilizers into the soil.</li>
</ul>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:18</b></div><div>How is humus formed?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Humus is formed from the decayed remains of dead plants and animals.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:19</b></div><div>How can we identify different types of soils?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>We can identify different types of soil by observing their texture and colour.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:20</b></div><div>Discuss the importance of moisture present in soil.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Moisture in the soil is important to determine the texture of the soil. It binds soil particles together. The moisture also determines when irrigation is necessary and the amount of water required.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:21</b></div><div>Which soil is best for growing crops and why?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Loamy soil helps retain water and also has high humus content.
