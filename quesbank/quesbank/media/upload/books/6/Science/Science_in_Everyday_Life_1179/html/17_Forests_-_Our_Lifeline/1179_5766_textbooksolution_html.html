</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:14</b></div><div>Explain how we depend on forests, directly or indirectly.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Mankind depends on forest either directly or indirectly for many things. Besides providing us with basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter, forests touch our lives in several other ways.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li>Most of the timber based industries rely on trees for the production of paper, plywood, pulp and cardboard.</li>
	<li>Several trees in the forest are used to produce ayurvedic medicines, essential oils, spices, nuts and oil. Resins, bamboo and latex which serve as raw materials to produce several things such as varnish, rubber, furniture, paper.</li>
	<li>Forests help in regulating the climate of a place and also help in increasing the rainfall by raising the water vapour content of the atmosphere.</li>
	<li>Forests help in preventing floods and soil erosion</li>
	<li>Few trees in the forest act as windbreakers against storms and strong tides.</li>

</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:15</b></div><div>With the help of an example, explain a food chain that exists in nature.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Food chain exists everywhere representing the flow of energy in nature. All food chains begin with producers of food which are green plants and end with consumers which are animals. A simple food chain could start with a rat feeding on grains. This rat is eaten by a snake. The snake in turn is eaten by an owl. This is a simple chain which shows the flow of energy from one organism to the other in order to live.<br />
<br />
Grains&nbsp;<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>&#8594;</mo></math> Rat <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>&#8594;</mo></math> Snake&nbsp;<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>&#8594;</mo></math> Owl</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:16</b></div><div>Explain a food web.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>A food web is a system of interconnected food chains. It is a complex network of energy flow from one organism to the other in a single ecosystem. Consider a rabbit and a mouse (see the representation below): Both the animals feed on green plants. A wild cat can eat both these animals. This cat can be eaten by a lion. This complex energy flow which appears just like a spider web is called a food web or food cycle. A frog that feeds on grasshopper can be eaten by an owl or a snake. Snake can also eat rabbit.<br />
A tropical food web is shown in the image:<br />

Plants and animals take in air to survive. Plants make food through a process called photosynthesis by absorbing in atmospheric carbon dioxide and releasing huge amounts of water vapour and oxygen as by-products. Moreover, forests also soak in large amounts of carbon dioxide released by animals and plants during respiration, during volcanic eruptions and also by burning coal and petroleum. This way forests help in purifying the air by maintaining the right levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:18</b></div><div>What is deforestation? Explain all the effects of deforestation.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Felling of trees on a large scale is called Deforestation. Deforestation results in complete destruction of forest resources. Effects of deforestation:&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li>Clearing of forests drastically changes the global climate. Many biological species will become extinct due to sudden change in climate.</li>
	<li>It may cause global warming by increasing the amount of green house gases in the atmosphere.</li>
	<li>With the felling of trees, we will be deprived of many natural resources such as medicinal plants, oils, timber and food.</li>
	<li>Deforestation also leads to soil erosion, excess flooding and landslides. This causes a severe damage to the life around.</li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:19</b></div><div>Explain some of the measures that could be followed to conserve our forests.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Following are the measures which help in conserving the forests:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li>Afforestation: Planting of trees on a large scale in places where there were no forests initially.</li>
	<li>Planned cultivation: Forests should not be completely cleared for agricultural purposes.</li>
	<li>Prevention of illegal logging: Indian government has laid out rules to punish anyone under law who involves in illegal cutting down of trees.</li>
	<li>Preventing overgrazing: Sufficient pastures should be provided for the cattle in the areas adjoining the forest so that trampling and overgrazing of growing plants by the cattle can be avoided.</li>
	<li>Protection from forest fires: Careful measures should be taken while burning debris so that animal and plant life in the nearby regions are not harmed.</li>
