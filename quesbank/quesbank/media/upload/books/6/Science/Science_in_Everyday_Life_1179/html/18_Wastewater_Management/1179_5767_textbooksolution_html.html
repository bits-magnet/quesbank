<body style="margin:0 auto;"><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:1</b></div><div>Describe the different sources of wastewater.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>&nbsp;The various sources of waste water are:<br />
a. Agriculture: Wastewater from farms contain pesticides and animal wastes.<br />
b. Industries: Wastewater generated from certain industries contains toxic chemicals such as lead and chromium.<br />
c. Mining and Constructions:&nbsp; Large amounts of waste water is generated from mining methods and wastewater generated from constructions contains cement and other compounds<br />
d. Hospitals and Offices: Waste water generated from hospitals and offices contain bacteria and germs<br />
e. Domestic activities: Waste water generated from domestic activities includes solid particles like metal, plastics, detergents and human faeces.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:2</b></div><div>Explain the sewer system.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Sewer system is a facility consisting of a system of pipelines to carry sewage. Sewage from our homes leaves through drain pipes and reaches sewer mains of the city. The sewage is then passed onto the wastewater treatment plants through larger pipes connected to the sewer mains underground. In order for the waste to flow easily, the sewer system has been given a slope. As the sewer pipes are underground, manholes are arranged at desired places so that persons can enter the sewers through the manhole and fix the blocked or leaky pipes.&nbsp;</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:3</b></div><div>Explain how wastewater gets treated in a wastewater treatment plant.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Wastewater gets treated in wastewater treatment plants in three stages. They are:<br />
(a) Primary treatment: This stage is a mechanical process involving screening and settling of large particles from waste water using vertical bars and grit chambers. After screening water is passed into sedimentation tanks .<br />
(b) Secondary treatment: This stage is a biological process which involves the breakdown of organic matter obtained from primary treatment with the help of bacteria, producing biogas. Water is sent into aeration tanks and air is blown through them to speed up the treatment of water.<br />
(c) Tertiary treatment: This stage is a chemical process and the last stage in treatment of water. Chemicals are added to remove phosphorous and nitrogen from water. Bacteria and other germs are killed by the addition of chlorine.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:4</b></div><div>Write one word for each of the following.

</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:13</b></div><div>How can treated water be used again?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>The treated water obtained from the waste water treatment plants are discharged into the rivers and streams. This treated water is used again for drinking supplies, domestic purposes, irrigation purposes in agriculture and aqua culture.&nbsp;</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:14</b></div><div>What happens to the sludge produced after wastewater passes through the sewage treatment plant?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Sludge that is produced after the wastewater passes through the sewage treatment plant consists of organic matter and huge quantities of water. At this stage, the sludge is thickened so as to ease the sludge disposal and this is in done by three methods:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li>Incinerating: Sludge is burnt to ashes and used as a construction material</li>
	<li>Dewatering: Sludge is dewatered and used in the production of fertilizers in combination with other wastes.</li>
	<li>Solid composting: Sludge is composted to produce gases which can then be used as fuel.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:15</b></div><div>Why is it important to maintain proper sanitation in public places?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>It is essential to maintain proper sanitation in public places because a large crowd gathers at these places. Hence, waste generation is also large. If the waste is not disposed properly, the sewer system would clog up resulting in blockage of sewage pipes and sewage would be thrown back onto the roads.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:16</b></div><div>Describe the measures that can be adopted to control sewage generation.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Some of the measures that can be employed to control the sewage generation are:<br />
a. Proper disposal of household products such as medicines, beauty products, cleansers and paint. These products contain various chemicals which might not be removed by wastewater treatment plants<br />
b. Using garbage cans to dispose plastics, meat, butter and cooking oils as they can clog drain pipes causing the sewage to overflow at homes or at public places.<br />
c. Fixing the faulty pipes as the leaks in pipes can contaminate drinking water. It may also cause stagnation at some places making it a breeding place for mosquitoes and disease causing germs.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:17</b></div><div>Describe the problems faced due to improper management of sewage.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Improper management of sewage gives rise to various problems such as contamination of water, water-borne diseases and water pollution. Discharge of untreated sewage into water bodies contaminate the water which cannot be consumed nor can be used for any domestic purposes. The contaminated water is also responsible for water-borne diseases such as jaundice, hepatitis and cholera. On the other hand, leakages or blocks in main water supply line to households cause the sewage to mix with water. This again leads to contamination of water and the consumption of such water results in dysentery and typhoid.</div><br/></body>
