The water treatment plants deliver treated water into the homes suitable for drinking. In rural areas, domestic water is obtained mostly from underground sources such as a motor driven tube well.</span></div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:9</b></div><div>Differentiate between precipitation and condensation?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:10</b></div><div>What is water table? How is a spring formed?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size:16px;">The seepage and collection of rainwater in the soil, sand and rocks under the ground is called underground water. Water table is the top level of this underground water. When this water table meets the land surface, water ejects out of the surface forming a natural spring which eventually flows into the lakes, streams and oceans.</span></div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:11</b></div><div>What are the causes of water scarcity in India?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size:16px;">Water is essential for life and though it is a natural renewable resource, it is being depleted at a faster rate causing scarcity of water. Some of the major factors contributing to scarcity of water in India are:</span>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Pollution of fresh water resources due to the discharge of toxins from the factories into the water bodies</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Uncontrolled use of bore well technology in removing ground water by the farmers</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">No effective measures being initiated to build fresh water ecosystems and very little is being done to recharge ground water.</span></li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:12</b></div><div>What is the effect of water scarcity on plants?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size:16px;">Water is very essential for the growth of the plant without which the plants would have reduced photosynthetic activity resulting in poor harvests. If the plants do not get adequate water, they will not reach the expected height, might get infected with diseases and eventually die. If the plants die, there will be no food and no oxygen, thus ceasing all kinds of life on earth.</span></div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:13</b></div><div>What are dams? How are dams responsible for the availability of water for the entire year for a particular region?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size:16px;">Dams are massive artificial walls built across rivers to regulate and retain water. Water is collected behind the walls in a reservoir. Dams include gates which can be opened or closed to channelize the water to the downstream regions. During dry seasons, when the river turns dry, these dams let out the collected water and regulate the water flow in the rivers and make water available evenly throughout the year.</span></div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:14</b></div><div>Fill in the blanks with the correct words.<br />

</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:15</b></div><div>State three major categories where water is used by us? Which category involves the maximum usage of water in India and why?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">Water is majorly used by us for agricultural, domestic and industrial purposes.</span><br />
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">India is an agricultural country, therefore a major portion of the water is used in agriculture. At least 90% of the total water is used for irrigation purposes due to unpredictable monsoons and scanty rainfall.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;In industries too, the demand for water has increased substantially over the years as water is used as a raw material, a coolant, a solvent, a transporting agent and also in producing electricity.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Water is used at homes for various domestic purposes such as drinking, cooking, cleaning, washing clothes and utensils and watering the plants.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:16</b></div><div>Describe the categories of the various source of water.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size:16px;">Sources of water can be mostly classified into two types which are:</span>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><u>Surface water</u>: Water found on the earth&rsquo;s surface is called surface water. This is sub classified into three types based on the purity of water. They are</span>:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Rain water: This is the purest form of water. Rain or snow which showers on the surface of the earth as a result of precipitation provides fresh water to our planet.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">River and lake water: The source of water in these water bodies is either from the rainfall or from the melting of snow on mountains.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Sea and ocean water: Oceans and seas are huge water bodies which have millions of litres of water in it.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">(b) <u>Underground water or subsoil water</u>: The seepage and collection of rainwater in the soil, sand and rocks under the ground is called underground water which can be brought to the surface in the form of springs or by drilling in wells.</span></div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:17</b></div><div>What are the various factors contributing to the depletion of the water table?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size:16px;">The major factors contributing to the depletion of the water table are:</span>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Increasing population: With a growing demand for houses, shops, roads etc, the numbers of the constructions works also have gone up. This results in the depletion of water table as usage of underground water is more when compared to the seepage.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Increasing Industries: Industries also use water at almost all levels of production putting a heavy load on fresh water ecosystems. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Agricultural activities: As India is an agricultural country, a huge portion of water is used in this sector for irrigation purposes. Plenty of ground water is used due to unpredictable monsoons. This cause depletion of the water table.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Deforestation: Deforestation also causes the water table to get depleted as ground water does not get recharged when the trees which have the potential to retain water are decreased in number.</span></li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:18</b></div><div>Why is there a need to conserve water? Describe the methods that can be adopted to conserve water.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-size:16px;">Water is essential for life without which we simply perish. Though it is a natural renewable resource, it is being depleted at a faster rate than it can be renewed. Therefore, conservation of water is very important in order to avoid water crisis. To conserve water, we all should adopt water saving practises such as:</span>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Fixing the leaking and dripping taps at households.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Recycling the water at homes.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Building dams and reservoirs to regulate and retain water.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Employing the method of drip irrigation in fields which helps in saving huge amounts of water and also doubles the harvest.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px;">Rainwater harvesting systems which capture and store rainwater directly.</span></li>
