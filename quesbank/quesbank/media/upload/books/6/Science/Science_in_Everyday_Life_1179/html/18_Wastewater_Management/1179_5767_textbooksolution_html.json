Sewage from our homes leaves through drain pipes and reaches sewer mains of the city. The sewage is then passed onto the wastewater treatment plants through larger pipes connected to the sewer mains underground. In order for the waste to flow easily, the sewer system has been given a slope. As the sewer pipes are underground, manholes are arranged at desired places so that persons can enter the sewers through the manhole and fix the blocked or leaky pipes.&nbsp;","isPublish":"1","isActive":"1","tcMapId":"47933","textbookId":"1179","chapterId":"5767","exerciseId":"309","flow":"2","pageFlow":"251","setNo":"1","pageNo":"251","questionNo":"2","exerciseFlow":"309","edition":"","tcMapIsActive":"1","sloId":"","sloMapId":"","sloMapIsActive":"","exerciseName":"Long Answers"},{"id":"40664","questionHtml":"Explain how wastewater gets treated in a wastewater treatment plant.","solutionHtml":"Wastewater gets treated in wastewater treatment plants in three stages. They are:<br \/>\r\n(a) Primary treatment: This stage is a mechanical process involving screening and settling of large particles from waste water using vertical bars and grit chambers. After screening water is passed into sedimentation tanks .<br \/>\r\n(b) Secondary treatment: This stage is a biological process which involves the breakdown of organic matter obtained from primary treatment with the help of bacteria, producing biogas. Water is sent into aeration tanks and air is blown through them to speed up the treatment of water.<br \/>\r\n(c) Tertiary treatment: This stage is a chemical process and the last stage in treatment of water. Chemicals are added to remove phosphorous and nitrogen from water. Bacteria and other germs are killed by the addition of chlorine.","isPublish":"1","isActive":"1","tcMapId":"47934","textbookId":"1179","chapterId":"5767","exerciseId":"309","flow":"3","pageFlow":"251","setNo":"1","pageNo":"251","questionNo":"3","exerciseFlow":"309","edition":"","tcMapIsActive":"1","sloId":"","sloMapId":"","sloMapIsActive":"","exerciseName":"Long
