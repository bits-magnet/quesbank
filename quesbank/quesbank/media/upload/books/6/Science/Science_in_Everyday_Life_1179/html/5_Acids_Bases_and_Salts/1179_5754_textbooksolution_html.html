</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:10</b></div><div>Why are most acids not stored in metal containers?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Acids are known for their corrosive nature. When brought in contact with metals such as iron or aluminium, acid chemically reacts with the metal and tends to destroy the metal gradually. Hence, it is advisable to store acids in glassware because glass is relatively less reactive to acids as compared to metals.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:11</b></div><div>What is the difference between dilute and concentrated acids?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>&nbsp;

</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:12</b></div><div>Write a short note on natural indicators.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Natural Indicators are the solutions prepared from various brightly coloured parts of plants such as flowers, stems, roots and leaves. The solutions are prepared by boiling the coloured parts in water for some time and thereafter straining the part. These indicator solutions show a change in colour in the presence of an acid or a base. Example: Red cabbage juice changes to deep red in acids and in the presence of bases, it changes to green and yellow.&nbsp;</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:13</b></div><div>Why is magnesium hydroxide used as an antacid?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Magnesium hydroxide is a weak base having low solubility in water. It reacts moderately with acids or water and is chemically safe to be consumed. Therefore, to relieve indigestion, it is used as an antacid as it helps in neutralizing excess acidity in the stomach.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:14</b></div><div>What is a neutralization reaction? Give one example.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>A reaction in which an acid and a base react with each other to form a salt is called a neutralization reaction. For example: Hydrochloric acid (acid) reacts with sodium hydroxide (a base) to form sodium chloride (common salt) and water. The chemical equation looks like this:<br />
<br />
HCl +NaOH <span style="font-family:times new roman,serif;">&rarr; </span>Nacl + H<sub>2</sub>O</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:15</b></div><div>How can a hydrated salt be converted into anhydrous salt?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Hydrated salts are the salt crystals which contain water molecules in them. These water molecules which give the crystal its shape is called water of crystallization. However, on heating, the hydrated salts lose their water of crystallization, shape and colour and get converted into a powdery substance called anhydrous salts.&nbsp;</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:16</b></div><div>List some properties of acids and bases.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Properties of Acids:
<ul>
	<li>Acids are sour&ndash;tasting chemicals.</li>
	<li>Acids are corrosive by nature and react strongly with metals.</li>
	<li>Most of the acids are soluble in water and form clear solutions on heating or at room temperature.</li>
</ul>
Properties of Bases:

<ul>
	<li>Bases are bitter-tasting chemicals</li>
	<li>Bases are soapy to touch</li>
	<li>Bases may or may not dissolve in water. The bases which are soluble in water are called alkalis.</li>
</ul>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:17</b></div><div>Give any three examples of acids. Give any two uses of each of them.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>The three examples of acids are:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;a. Hydrochloric acid (HCl):<br />
Uses:<br />
(i) Hydrochloric acid is contained in sanitary ware cleaners which is used for cleaning purposes at homes.<br />
(ii) Dilute hydrochloric acid is used to remove deposits from the inside of the heating appliances such as boilers.<br />
<br />
b. Sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>):<br />
Uses:<br />
(i) Sulphuric acid is used in the production of fertilizers.<br />
(ii) Sulphuric acid, also known as the king of chemicals is used in the manufacture of various chemicals, dyes and drugs.<br />
<br />
c. Nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>):<br />
Uses:<br />
(i) Nitric acid is used in producing fertilizers such as Ammonium Nitrate<br />
(ii) It is used for cleaning gold and silver ornaments.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:18</b></div><div>Give any three example of bases. Give any two uses of each of them.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Three examples of bases:<br />
a. Calcium Hydroxide [Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>]:<br />
(i) Calcium hydroxide is an ingredient in mortar, cement and whitewash.<br />
(ii) It is used as a chemical reagent in Bordeaux mixture to protect crops from pests.<br />
<br />
b. Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH):<br />
(i) Sodium hydroxide is used in the manufacture of detergents and also in the textile industry.<br />
(ii) It is used at homes as a drain cleaner to unclog the drains.<br />
<br />
c. Magnesium Hydroxide [Mg(OH)]:<br />
(i) Magnesium hydroxide is used as an antacid as it is effective in neutralizing acids in the stomach.<br />
(ii) It is also used as a laxative in relieving constipation.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:19</b></div><div>What is the effect of sulphuric acid on the following?<br />
<br />
(a) Red litmus<br />
(b) Blue litmus<br />
(c) Phenolphthalein</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Acids turn blue litmus paper to red. Sulphuric acid belongs to the category of acids. Let us see the effect of sulphuric acid on<br />
(a) Red litmus: If the litmus paper is red, sulphuric acid will not have any effect on the paper. The litmus paper will remain red.<br />
(b) Blue litmus: The blue litmus paper changes to red in the presence of sulphuric acid.<br />
(c) Phenolphthalein: Phenolphthalein is an indicator solution which turns colourless in the presence of acids. Therefore, in the presence of sulphuric acid, phenolphthalein turns colourless.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:20</b></div><div><p>Explain the following:<br />
<br />
(a) Calamine lotion is applied on bee stings.<br />
(b) Antacids are taken in case of acidity in stomach.<br />
(c) Slaked lime is added to factory waste before it is discharged into rivers.</p>
</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>(a) Calamine lotion contains a base called zinc carbonate which has a neutralizing effect on acids. A bee sting releases an acidic liquid into the skin. In order to neutralize the effect of the bee sting, calamine lotion is rubbed on the skin.<br />
<br />
(b) In case of acidity in stomach, an antacid such as magnesium hydroxide is taken. Magnesium Hydroxide is a base which is known to be very effective in neutralizing acids. Therefore, to relieve indigestion, an antacid is taken as it helps in correcting the excess acidity in the stomach.<br />
<br />
(c) Calcium hydroxide or slaked lime is a base which has a neutralizing effect on acids. It is added to the factory waste before being discharged into rivers because the factory waste contains many acids. The acids are very toxic and will destroy the aquatic life. In order to neutralize the acidic components in the waste, slaked lime is added to it.</div><br/></body>
