<br />
(a) Places in India are generally much warmer the Greenland.<br />
(b) It is generally cooler during the nights than during the day.<br />
(c) Mumbai has greater humidity than Delhi.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>(a) India is closer to the equator; as a result the sun&rsquo;s rays directly fall over there, while they fall at angles on the poles as in Greenland. Hence, places in India are warmer than the Greenland.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(b) It is generally cooler nights during the nights than during the day, as during the day the sun rays heat up the earth.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(c) As Mumbai is closer to the sea it has greater humidity than places like Delhi that are far away from the sea.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:15</b></div><div>Mention briefly how the following animals make adaptations to survive in hot and dry desert climates:<br />
<br />
(a) Camel<br />
(b) Kangaroo rat<br />
(c) Fennec</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>The following adaptations are made by the animals to survive in hot and dry desert<br />
(a)Camels have long eyelashes and ear hair to prevent sand entering inside, thick eyebrows to provide shade and wide feet to walk in sand without sinking. They can withstand high temperature changes. They have thick lips to eat prickly desert plants and their hump is a reservoir of fatty tissue to go without food for months.<br />
(b) Kangaroo rats are active in morning and evening to escape the heat. They live in burrows to block midday heat and recycle moisture from their breathing. They do not drink water and survive on dry seeds.&nbsp;<br />
(c) Fennec moves in search of food at night to escape the hot sun and stays in the den during the day. Its long ears help to dissipate heat.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:16</b></div><div>How are animals living in hot and humid areas adapted to keep their bodies cool?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><ol>
	<li>Animals living in hot and humid areas have adaptations for temperature regulation and evaporation of water to avoid getting uncomfortable and cooling their bodies.</li>
	<li>Faster evaporation is induced by sweating, licking and panting.</li>
	<li>They have long legs and tails and many also have large ears. The long legs keep their bodies above the hot ground.</li>
	<li>Flapping of long ears helps in blowing air and cooling their body.</li>
	<li>They are more active during early morning, evening and night.</li>
</ol>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:17</b></div><div>Mention briefly how the following animals make adaptations to survive in extremely cold climates:<br />
<br />
(a) Polar bear<br />
(b) Arctic fox</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>The following adaptations are made by these animals to survive in cold climates
<ul>
	<li>Polar bears have blubber, a thick layer of fat under their skin to keep them warm. Their white fur provides insulation against cold and helps to hide from their prey to be able to hunt on land and in water. Female polar bears hibernate in the den during worst winter and cubs are also born there.</li>
	<li>Arctic foxes have large furry paws that act as snow shoes that help them to move easily in the snow. Their furry and ears help to protect from cold.</li>
