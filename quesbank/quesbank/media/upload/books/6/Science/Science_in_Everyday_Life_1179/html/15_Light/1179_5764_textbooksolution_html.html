</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:10</b></div><div>Give two common uses of curved mirrors.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Curved mirrors are reflecting surfaces which form images of the objects when placed in front of them. Curved mirrors are of two types; concave mirrors which are bulged inwards and convex mirrors are bulged outwards. Uses:<br />
a. Convex mirrors make objects appear smaller than they usually are so as to give a wide view of the surroundings. This makes it useful in big shops and supermarkets to spot the shoplifters.<br />
b. Concave mirrors make objects appear larger when placed very close to the mirror.&nbsp; Therefore they are commonly used as shaving mirrors or dentist mirrors.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:11</b></div><div>Where would we commonly find lenses?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-family:calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;">A lens is an optical device made of glass or any other transparent material. The curved surfaces of the lenses either converge or diverge the light rays falling on it and form an image of the object. Most common lenses are concave and convex lenses and they are found in spectacles, cameras, binoculars, telescopes and magnifying glasses.</span></span></div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:12</b></div><div>How could we split white light into its constituent colours?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>A glass prism can be used to show the splitting of white light into its constituent colours. A prism is an optical device with two refracting surfaces. When white light such as sunlight passes through a prism, it splits the light into a band of colours called spectrum. This spectrum can be seen on a screen placed in front of the prism. The spectrum consists of colours which are visible to the human eye namely violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red (VIBGYOR).</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:13</b></div><div>If we want a clear image of an object, what kind of surface should we use?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>In order to obtain a clear image of an object, the surface on which the light falls should be smooth or regular. A smooth or regular surface such as a mirror reflects the light only in one direction. As a result, a mirror produces a clear image of an object.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:14</b></div><div>What kind of image does a plane mirror produce?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>A plane mirror acts like a reflecting surface and produces an erect and virtual image of an object.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:15</b></div><div>Which lens always produces a diminished image?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>A concave lens always produces a diminished, virtual and erect image of an object, irrespective of the position of the object from the lens.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:16</b></div><div>Give the nature of the image formed by a convex lens when the object is between F and 2F (where F is the focal length of the lens).</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><span style="font-family:calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;">When the position of the object is between F and 2F (where F is the focal length of the lens), the nature of the image formed by a convex lens is real, inverted and magnified.</span></span></div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:17</b></div><div>Where should we place an object in front of a convex lens so that the image is formed at infinity?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>When the position of the object is at the focal length of the lens (F), the position of the image formed by a convex lens is at infinity.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:18</b></div><div>Give reasons for the following:<br />
<br />
(a) We cannot see a source of light through a bent tube.<br />
(b) Convex mirrors are used in a car wing mirrors.<br />
(c) A concave mirror is used as a dentist&#39;s mirror.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>(a): We cannot see a source of light through a bent tube because a bent tube is not a uniform medium. In order to see the source of light, the tube should be a straight uniform medium because light travels in straight lines. A tube which is bent obstructs the path of light from reaching the eye.<br />
(b): Convex mirror is a curved object which bulges outwards to form a reflecting surface. The images formed in a convex mirror are therefore very small giving a wider range of view of the surroundings. Therefore a convex mirror finds its use in a car wing mirror as it helps in giving a wide view behind the car.<br />
(c): Concave mirror is a reflecting surface which curves inwards. The image of any object appears larger when kept very close to the concave mirror. Therefore it is used as a dentist&rsquo;s mirror to examine inside the mouth.</div><br/></body>
