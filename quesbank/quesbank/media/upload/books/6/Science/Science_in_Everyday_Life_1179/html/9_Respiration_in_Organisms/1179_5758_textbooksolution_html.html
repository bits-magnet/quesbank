<ul>
	<li>Skin &ndash; In some animals respiration takes place with their moist and slimy skin surface. E.g., leeches and earthworms. Amphibians respire with skin when in water and with lungs when on land. E.g., frogs, newts.</li>
	<li>Air holes &ndash; In insects, there are air holes or spiracles present on their body, which enable the entry of oxygen rich air and giving out carbon dioxide rich air. E.g., cockroaches</li>
	<li>Gills &ndash; Many aquatic animals have gills, which are made up of filaments having blood vessels or capillaries. The blood in capillaries helps to absorb oxygen in water, transports in the body and gives out carbon dioxide. E.g., Fish</li>
	<li>Lungs &ndash; Most mammals respire with lungs, which are sac like spongy organs in the body. E.g. ,monkeys, cats, human beings, etc.</li>
</ul>

<br />
In humans, lungs are the organs of respiration, which are present inside the chest and protected by the rib cage. The ribs support the lungs and help in pumping air in and out while breathing. Underneath the lungs, there is a dome shaped muscle called diaphragm. When the diaphragm contracts, oxygen rich air is pulled inside the lungs. Exchange of gases takes place in the lungs and carbon dioxide is pumped out from the lungs when the diaphragm relaxes.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:17</b></div><div>Explain in detail how air enters and leaves the lungs.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>While inhaling, air enters the nose, travels through the nasal cavity, larynx, trachea and bronchi and enters the lungs when the diaphragm contracts. Further, air passes through the bronchioles and enters the alveoli, where exchange of gases takes place. Absorbed oxygen is taken up by the blood and carbon dioxide, which is brought from all parts of the body, is pumped out of lungs when diaphragm relaxes. On exhaling, this carbon dioxide rich air flows through the reverse route and moves out through the nose.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:18</b></div><div>How would you show that exhaled air has more carbon dioxide than inhaled air?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Exhaled air has more carbon dioxide can be shown by an experiment requiring two disposable glasses with covers and a hole on their top, two straws and some lime water. The glasses need to be filled with lime water. Then, in first glass, air is allowed to enter through the straw and in the second glass exhaled air is blown through the straw. It is observed that lime water in first glass is only slightly milky while that in the second, it is very milky. This shows that the exhaled air has more carbon dioxide, which turned lime water more milky than the inhaled air.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:19</b></div><div>Differentiate between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:20</b></div><div>How would you demonstrate that oxygen is used up during aerobic respiration?</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Aerobic respiration uses oxygen is shown with an experiment that requires some seeds, a beaker, glass tube, round bottom glass flask, laboratory stand, KOH pellets and mercury.<br />
Some germinating seeds are placed in the round bottom flask, which is inserted into glass tube and the tube is inverted into a beaker filled with mercury. KOH pellets are placed in glass tube to prevent seeds from absorbing carbon dioxide.<br />
Another set up is arranged without placing KOH pellets. After a day, it is observed that mercury level rises in the tube having KOH pellets, while in other it remains unchanged. This concludes that oxygen is used up by the seeds during aerobic respiration, which lowered the pressure in the bulb and raised mercury level in the tube. &nbsp;</div><br/></body>
