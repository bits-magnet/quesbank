It has four chambers that are surrounded by three thick muscular walls, i.e., epicardium, myocardium and endocardium.<br />
The heart in humans is four-chambered. The two upper chambers of the heart are called the right and left atria while the two lower chambers are called right and left ventricles. The right and the left atria are separated by the inter-atrial septum and the two ventricles are separated by a wall called the inter-ventricular septum. The two atria receive blood from the body, while the ventricles pump blood to the body. The openings between the upper and lower chambers are controlled by valves that help the blood to flow in only one direction. The vessels that carry the pumped blood away from the heart are aorta and pulmonary artery while the pulmonary vein and the vena cava bring blood from the body into the heart.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:39</b></div><div>Write in detail about the three vegetative methods of reproduction. Describe two advantages of this kind of reproduction.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><p>The three methods of vegetative or asexual reproduction are:</p>

<p>1. Budding: In this method of reproduction, the body of the parent produces an offspring from a small bulb like projection called bud that grows and separates from the parent cell and forms&nbsp;a new cell.</p>

<p>2. Fragmentation: In this method, the body of the parent is split into smaller fragments when water and other nutrients are available. These smaller fragments or pieces grow and develop into new organisms.</p>

<p>3. Spore formation: In this method, spores are the vegetative (asexual) reproductive organs. These spores are covered by a hard protective layer which breaks down under favourable conditions to produce a new individual.</p>

<p>Following are the advantages of vegetative reproduction:</p>

<p>1. Reproduction takes places at a rapid rate under favourable conditions. A large number of new individuals are formed in less time from a single cell.</p>

<p>2. Offsprings formed out of vegetative reproduction have better chances of survival as large number of new individuals are produced.</p>
</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:40</b></div><div>Explain fertilization and how it leads to fruit and seed formation.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div>Fertilization: A process in which male and female gametes of a flower&nbsp;(pollen and egg respectively) fuse with each other to form a single celled zygote. This zygote develops into an embryo and finally into a new plant.<br />
<br />
After the fertilization process, various parts of the plant show various changes.&nbsp; The sepal of the flower either withers away or remains attached even after the fertilization in certain plants. The stamen and&nbsp;anther&nbsp;of the flower withers away.<br />
A fruit is formed when the ovary in the flower gets enlarged and the ovules present in the flowers&nbsp;forms the&nbsp;seeds.</div><br/><br/><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Question:41</b></div><div>Explain in detail the difference between winds and monsoon winds.</div><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><b>Solution:</b></div><div><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;">

Cyclones are huge rotating winds caused by difference in the atmospheric pressure. Cyclones are formed from thunder storms and its formation depends on the speed and direction of the wind, humidity and temperature. The main source of energy are the warm&nbsp; moisture driven clouds that form in the oceans and seas. Cyclones can&nbsp;cause disasters&nbsp;such as floods and diseases and leave thousands of people homeless.<br />
<br />
Tornadoes:<br />
Tornadoes are ferocious and dangerous rotating columns of air extending from&nbsp;a thunderstorm to the surface of the earth.<br />
They are usually referred as twisters or cyclones and come in many shapes and sizes with the narrow end touching the earth&#39;s surface. Tornadoes are short lived winds but can grab in anything and everything that comes in its path.</div><br/></body>
