Ancient people used calendars similar to the present ones to measure time. Later on sundials and hour glass were used to keep a track of time. Apart from this, water clocks were also used in some parts of the world. But all these devices were not able to measure the time accurately. Later on,Christian Huygens in 1656 developed pendulum clock that showed a reliable time measure than the earlier ones. Later on, atomic clocks were invented that showed the measurement of time accurately.<\/span><\/span>","isPublish":"1","isActive":"1","tcMapId":"47792","textbookId":"1179","chapterId":"5761","exerciseId":"309","flow":"2","pageFlow":"175","setNo":"1","pageNo":"175","questionNo":"2","exerciseFlow":"309","edition":"","tcMapIsActive":"1","sloId":"","sloMapId":"","sloMapIsActive":"","exerciseName":"Long Answers"},{"id":"40563","questionHtml":"Explain the factors on which the time period of a simple pendulum depends.","solutionHtml":"<span style=\"font-family:times new roman,serifmso-list:ignore;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Time period of a simple pendulum is defined as the time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation.
